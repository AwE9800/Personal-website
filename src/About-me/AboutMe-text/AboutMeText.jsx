                    Hello there! I'm Alvin Samuelsson, a passionate frontend developer currently in my first year at KYH. I have a strong
                    passion for creating web experiences. My journey in frontend development has been filled with exciting discoveries and
                    challenges. Throughout my studies, I've not only delved into the fundamentals like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript but have
                    also explored modern frameworks like React to elevate my projects to the next level.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    When I'm not in front of the computer coding, I dedicate my time to being with my family and friends, working out, and
                    watching AIK play football. This balance between coding and personal interests has been the key to my creativity and
                    well-being
