## Overview

### The challenge

Your task is to develop an interactive Single Page Application (SPA) that functions as a CV or personal website using a JavaScript framework. The web app should present information about yourself, including your skills, experiences, projects, and contact information.

Your finished project should follow the component structure and data flow you have established in the written submission. In addition, the web app should meet the technical requirements outlined below.

Technical Requirements:

Component Structure and Data Flow

Create reusable components to structure your website.
Use props to pass data between components to ensure efficient data flow.
React Router

Implement React Router to manage navigation between different sections or pages on the website. You should have at least three views, such as 'About Me,' 'Projects,' and 'Contact.'
useState Hook

Use the useState hook to manage local state in at least one component in your web app. For example, you can use it to create an interactive contact form or another interactive section.
Redux

Integrate Redux for global state management. This can be used to handle user preferences (such as theme or layout) or to store and manage data used by multiple components.
Code Standard and Documentation

Write clean and well-organized code. Comment the code where necessary to explain complex or important parts.
Include a README file that describes the project, how to run it, and an overview of its features.

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   React
-   Javascript
-   Redux
-   Github-API

### What I learned

Throughout this project, I have learned how to use React and how to utilize routes. I have also experimented with using Redux and API.

### Continued development

I enjoy using React, but I don't feel confident using Redux and fetching data from an API. It's something I want to work on in future projects.

## Acknowledgments

I want to extend a big thank you to my classmates Dennis, Eric, Kalle, and Pontus, who have supported and helped me throughout the project.

## React-Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

-   [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
-   [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
